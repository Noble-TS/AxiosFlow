# AxiosFlow
## Revolutionizing Frontend API Interaction
AxiosFlow is a powerful library that simplifies and streamlines frontend API interactions. It is designed to transform how developers interact with APIs, offering a seamless, type-safe, and developer-friendly approach to API consumption.
### Key Features
*   **Type Safety**: AxiosFlow ensures that API calls are type-safe, reducing errors and improving
code quality.
*   **Automatic Type Generation**: Automatically generates fully typed API client functions,eliminates manual type definitions and reduces boilerplate code ,and ensures compile-time type safety for API interactions
*   **Type-Safe API Calls**: Provides end-to-end type inference from backend to frontend, catches potential type mismatches during development, and enhances code reliability and reduces runtime errors
*   **Extensive Support**: AxiosFlow supports a wide range of features, including
pagination, caching, and more.
*   **Decorator-Based API Definition**: Use simple decorators to define API endpoints, intuitive, clean syntax for API method declarations, and minimal configuration required
*   **Intelligent Type Inference**: Automatically extracts request and response types,supports complex type structures and nested objects, and works seamlessly with TypeScript's type system




AxiosFlow API
